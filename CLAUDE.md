# CustomCamera - Claude Code Configuration

## Project Overview
Modern Kotlin camera app with Samsung/Google-style floating UI, robust camera selection, and graceful error handling for broken cameras.

**Status**: MVP Complete, Camera ID Selection Issue Under Investigation
**Technology**: Kotlin, CameraX, Material3, ViewBinding
**Architecture**: Clean Android with defensive programming patterns

## Build Commands
- `./gradlew assembleDebug`: Build debug APK
- `./gradlew clean assembleDebug`: Clean build
- `adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`: Install app
- `adb logcat -d | grep "customcamera\|CameraActivity\|CameraSelection"`: Check app logs

## Current Issues
### HIGH PRIORITY
1. **Camera ID Selection Not Respected** (ACTIVE BUG)
   - User selects camera 1 or 2 in selection screen
   - Camera app still uses camera 0 (back camera)
   - Enhanced logging added but issue persists
   - Location: `CameraActivity.kt:selectCamera()` method

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
2. **Missing Drawable Resources**
   - Need to add remaining icon drawables referenced in layouts
   - Files: `ic_flash_on.xml`, `ic_flash_off.xml`, `ic_switch_camera.xml`, `ic_gallery.xml`
   - Status: Partially created, may need refinement

3. **Camera 0 Broken Handling**
   - App should gracefully handle when camera 0 (back camera) is broken
   - Current fallback logic exists but needs testing
   - Should cycle through all cameras to find working one

### LOW PRIORITY
4. **Gallery Integration**
   - Gallery button opens system picker but could be enhanced
   - Consider showing last captured photo instead of generic picker

5. **Settings Implementation**
   - Settings button currently shows "coming soon" message
   - Could add camera resolution, quality, timer features

## Technical Debt
- Deprecated systemUiVisibility warnings (Android 11+ issue)
- ViewBinding could be further leveraged for type safety
- Error handling could be more granular with custom exceptions
- Camera selection screen UI could be more polished

```
MainActivity ‚Üí CameraSelectionActivity ‚Üí CameraActivity
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì                        ‚Üì
Launch camera ‚Üí Select camera index ‚Üí Use selected camera
                     ‚Üì                        ‚Üë
               Pass via Intent extras ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
               Key: EXTRA_CAMERA_INDEX (Int)
```

## Development Workflow

### Session Startup
1. `cd ~/git/swype/CustomCamera`
2. Check current status: `git status`
3. Review active issues in this CLAUDE.md
4. Focus on highest priority items first

### Testing Workflow
1. Make code changes
2. `./gradlew assembleDebug`
3. `adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
4. Test on device
5. `adb logcat -d | grep "customcamera"` for debugging

### Debugging Camera Issues
1. Check logs for camera enumeration: "Available cameras: X"
2. Verify intent passing: "Intent extra value: X"
3. Trace camera selector creation: "Creating camera selector for index X"
4. Confirm camera binding: "Camera bound successfully"

## Known Working Components
- ‚úÖ Project builds successfully with Kotlin + CameraX
- ‚úÖ Camera permission handling works correctly
- ‚úÖ Camera enumeration detects all available cameras
- ‚úÖ UI layouts inflate without theme conflicts
- ‚úÖ Basic camera preview and capture functionality
- ‚úÖ Floating UI design matches modern camera apps
- ‚úÖ Error handling prevents crashes

## Next Session Priorities
1. **Fix camera ID selection issue** - highest priority
2. **Add missing drawable resources** for complete UI
3. **Test camera 0 broken scenario** thoroughly
4. **Implement settings screen** for camera configuration
5. **Add video recording capability**

## Camera Selection Debug Strategy
The current issue appears to be that the camera selector filter isn't properly constraining to the selected camera. Consider these approaches:
1. Test with different devices to see if it's device-specific
2. Try binding cameras one at a time to isolate the working one
3. Use CameraCharacteristics for more direct camera control
4. Implement camera testing during selection phase
