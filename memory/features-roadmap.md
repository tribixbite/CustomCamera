### ðŸš§ CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix First)

#### 1. Camera ID Selection Bug (P0)
**Status**: BROKEN - Not respecting selected camera ID
**Impact**: Core functionality compromised
**Files**:
- `CameraActivity.kt:selectCamera()` method
- `CameraActivity.kt:createCameraSelectorForIndex()` method

**Problem**: User selects camera 1 or 2, but app always uses camera 0
**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Debug camera filter execution
- [ ] Try alternative camera selection methods
- [ ] Test with different devices/camera configurations

#### 2. Camera 0 Broken Handling (P1)
**Status**: UNTESTED - Logic exists but needs validation
**Impact**: App might fail on devices with broken back camera
**Files**:
- `CameraActivity.kt:handleCameraError()` method
- `CameraActivity.kt:selectCamera()` fallback logic

**Test Scenarios**:
- [ ] Device with only front camera available
- [ ] Device with broken/inaccessible back camera
- [ ] Device with unusual camera configurations

- [ ] **Zoom Implementation**
  - Pinch-to-zoom gesture handling
  - Zoom level indicator
  - Smooth zoom animations

- [ ] **Exposure & White Balance**
  - Exposure compensation slider
  - White balance presets (auto, daylight, fluorescent, etc.)
  - Manual color temperature control

#### Pro Camera Features
- [ ] **Manual Controls**
  ```kotlin
  // ISO selection
  // Shutter speed control
  // Manual focus distance
  // Aperture control (if supported)
  ```

- [ ] **Advanced UI**
  - Histogram overlay
  - Camera information display
  - Grid overlay options
  - Level indicator

#### Special Modes
- [ ] **Night Mode**
  - Low-light optimization
  - Extended exposure handling
  - Noise reduction processing

- [ ] **Portrait Mode** (if multi-camera)
  - Depth-based background blur
  - Portrait lighting effects
  - Bokeh intensity control

### Phase 4: Optimization & Polish (Sessions 11+)

#### Performance Optimization
- [ ] **Memory Management**
  - Optimize preview resolution for device
  - Efficient bitmap handling
  - Background thread optimization

- [ ] **Camera Repository Pattern**
  ```kotlin
  class CameraRepository {
      suspend fun getAvailableCameras(): List<CameraInfo>
      suspend fun bindCamera(cameraId: String): Camera?
      suspend fun capturePhoto(): Result<Uri>
  }
  ```

#### Advanced Error Handling
- [ ] **Custom Exception Classes**
  ```kotlin
  sealed class CameraError : Exception() {
      object NoCamerasAvailable : CameraError()
      data class CameraBindingFailed(val cameraId: String) : CameraError()
      data class CaptureError(val reason: String) : CameraError()
  }
  ```

## UI/UX Specifications

### Design System
- **Theme**: Material3 DayNight
- **Colors**: Dark theme with white controls
- **Typography**: Material3 type scale
- **Animations**: Smooth 100-300ms transitions

### Button Specifications
```
Capture Button: 88dp Ã— 88dp, white circle, 8dp elevation
Control Buttons: 64dp Ã— 64dp, semi-transparent circles
Icon Padding: 16-18dp for optimal touch targets
Button Spacing: 32-40dp horizontal margins
```

### Layout Patterns
- **FrameLayout** for overlapping camera preview and controls
- **Floating Controls** positioned at top and bottom edges
- **Material3 Components** for consistent styling
- **Responsive Design** works across different screen sizes

## Data Models & Contracts

### Intent Contracts
```kotlin
// CameraSelectionActivity â†’ CameraActivity
const val EXTRA_CAMERA_INDEX = "camera_index"
intent.putExtra(EXTRA_CAMERA_INDEX, selectedCameraIndex: Int)
```

### Camera State Models
```kotlin
data class CameraConfig(
    val index: Int,
    val lensFacing: Int,
    val hasFlash: Boolean,
    val isWorking: Boolean
)

data class CaptureSettings(
    val resolution: Size,
    val quality: Int,
    val format: String,
    val location: File
)
```

## Testing Matrix

### Device Categories
1. **Single Camera Devices** (Budget phones, tablets)
   - Expected: Camera 0 only
   - Test: App handles gracefully

2. **Dual Camera Devices** (Standard phones)
   - Expected: Camera 0 (back), Camera 1 (front)
   - Test: Selection between front/back works

3. **Multi-Camera Devices** (Flagship phones)
   - Expected: Camera 0 (back), 1 (front), 2+ (additional)
   - Test: Selection of camera 2+ works correctly

### Edge Cases
- **Broken Camera 0**: Most common issue on older devices
- **Missing Front Camera**: Some devices only have back camera
- **External Cameras**: USB or wireless cameras
- **Driver Issues**: OEM-specific camera problems

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Camera preview: ~50MB memory usage
- Photo capture: Temporary spike during processing
- Multiple cameras: Each binding uses additional memory

### CPU Usage
- Preview rendering: Continuous moderate usage
- Photo processing: Spike during capture
- Camera switching: Brief high usage during rebinding

### Battery Impact
- Camera usage: High battery drain
- Flash usage: Additional power consumption
- Screen brightness: Full brightness during camera use
